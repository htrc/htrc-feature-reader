    "Tools for working with the [HTRC Extracted Features dataset](https://sharc.hathitrust.org/features), a dataset of page-level text features extracted from 17 million digitized works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library provides a `FeatureReader` for parsing files, which are handled as `Volume` objects with collections of `Page` objects. Volumes provide access to metadata (e.g. language), volume-wide feature information (e.g. token counts), and access to Pages. Pages allow you to easily parse page-level features, particularly token lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library makes heavy use of [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org), returning many data representations as DataFrames. This is the leading way of dealing with structured data in Python, so this library doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Since refactoring around Pandas, the primary benefit of using the HTRC Feature Reader is performance: reading the json structures and parsing them is generally faster than custom code. You also get convenient access to common information, such as case-folded token counts or part-of-page specific character counts. Details of the public methods provided by this library can be found in the [HTRC Feature Reader docs](http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "To install,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    pip install htrc-feature-reader\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! This library is written for Python 3.0+. For Python beginners, you'll need [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, if you are using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), you can install with\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    conda install -c htrc htrc-feature-reader\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `conda` approach is recommended, because it makes sure that some of the hard-to-install dependencies are properly installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of data analysis, using iPython with Jupyter notebooks for preparing your scripts interactively is a recommended convenience. Most basically, it can be installed with `pip install ipython[notebook]` and run with `ipython notebook` from the command line, which starts a session that you can access through your browser. If this doesn't work, consult the [iPython documentation](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/).\n",

    "### Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "For large jobs, you'll want to use multiprocessing or multithreading to speed up your process. This is left up to your preferred method, either within Python or by spawning multiple scripts from the command line. Here are two approaches that I like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask offers easy multithreading (shared resources) and multiprocessing (separate processes) in Python, and is particularly convenient because it includes a subset of Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a minimal example, that lazily loads token frequencies from a list of volume IDs, and counts them up by part of speech tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dask.dataframe as dd\n",
    "from dask import delayed\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_tokenlist(vol):\n",
    "    ''' Load a one volume feature reader, get that volume, and return its tokenlist '''\n",
    "    return FeatureReader(ids=[volid]).first().tokenlist()\n",
    "\n",
    "delayed_dfs = [delayed(get_tokenlist)(volid) for volid in volids]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a dask\n",
    "ddf = (dd.from_delayed(delayed_dfs)\n",
    "         .reset_index()\n",
    "         .groupby('pos')[['count']]\n",
    "         .sum()\n",
    "      )\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run processing\n",
    "ddf.compute()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of 78 volumes being processed in 24 seconds with 31 threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Counting POS in 78 books about knitting](data/dask-progress.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example used multithreading. Due to the nature of Python, certain functions won't parallelize well. In our case, the part where the JSON is read from the file and converted to a DataFrame (the light green parts of the graphic) won't speed up because Python dicts lock the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, because Pandas releases the GIL, nearly everything you do after parsing the JSON will be very quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand what happens when `ddf.compute()`, here is a graph for 4 volumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](data/dask-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GNU Parallel\n",
    "As an alternative to multiprocessing in Python, my preference is to have simpler Python scripts and to use GNU Parallel on the command line. To do this, you can set up your Python script to take variable length arguments of feature file paths, and to print to stdout.\n",
    "\n",
    "This psuedo-code shows how that you'd use parallel, where the number of parallel processes is 90% the number of cores, and 50 paths are sent to the script at a time (if you send too little at a time, the initialization time of the script can add up).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find feature-files/ -name '*json.bz2' | parallel --eta --jobs 90% -n 50 python your_script.py >output.txt\n",
